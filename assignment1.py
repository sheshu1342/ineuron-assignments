# 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
# 
#     
#     *  =Multiplication Expression
# 'hello' = string
# -87.8 = values _float
# -  = Expression
# /  = Expression
# +	= Expression
# 6  = value 
# 
# 
# 2. What is the difference between string and variable?
# String contains charecters which can be filled inside varibles . variables are the data holding (data storing).
# 
# 3. Describe three different data types.
# String , integer , tuples, dictionary ,list
# 
# 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
# Expression contains values and operators. It brings down it to single value or excecutes the expression
# 
# 
# 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
# Expression is  to excuition of values and functions into single entity . where Statement it self a  single entity.
# 
# 
# 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
# bacon = 22
# bacon + 1
# ans : 22
# 7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
# 'spam' + 'spamspam'
# ans : 'spamspamspam'
# 
# 
# 'spam' * 3
# ans : 'spamspamspam'
# 
# 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
# Variable contains values/stores data, so numbers cant be a variable . mathematically inequality will arise like( 1 = 100) to avoid these also varibles starts with charecters.
# 
# 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
# Int() ,float() ,str()
# 
# 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
# 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
# 
# ans :'I have eaten ' + ‘99’ + ' burritos.'
